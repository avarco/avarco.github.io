      <description>Make sure you have an Ethereum wallet that is not from an cryptocurrency exchange for security reasons. If you want to buy ether for your wallet, we highly recommend an exchange like Binance.  Send ETH to the token address listed on the AVARC (https://avarc.co) homepage and make sure to check EtherScan to track your purchase and verify that it went through. Keep your AVC tokens safe until marketplace launch.</description>

      <title>Update: the AVARC ICO was a bluff -- maybe it wasn&#39;t</title>

      <description>April 1, 2018 was unique in two ways: it was Easter Sunday, and eerily, fool&amp;rsquo;s day.
The team at AVARC in conjunction with a long time friend, who is big on Ethereum and the blockchain at large, worked on a small fun project &amp;ndash; AVARC ICO. For the uninitiated, an ICO &amp;ndash; Initial Coin Offering &amp;ndash; is the sale of a token/coin/promise(s) [similar to the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin] to willing buyers for several reasons.</description>

      <title>AVARC ICO — Initial Coin Offering — seeks to raise US$ 1 million</title>

      <description>There is currently no effective marketplace for creatives in the sports apparel market segment. Indeed, incumbents such as Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Asics among others control not only their designs and quality of sports apparel and ensemble but also dictate what markets they serve, at what price points. In so doing, low and mid income groups in the developed world and emerging markets are excluded. Unserved markets end up with not only used and environmentally unfriendly material but also cheap and low-quality knock-offs.</description>

      <description>The world’s largest sports apparel and equipment makers run large closed and proprietary systems. They have absolute control over their value chains; from design, prices, and what markets they serve. While this control is standard practice for the co-op, it excludes users with incredible and extra creative power from participating in value creation and also excludes those in unserved markets, especially in emerging economies.</description>
